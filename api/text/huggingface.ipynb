    "output_chatgpt = '''Once upon a time in the magical land of Harmony Hills, there lived a group of furry little\n",
    " creatures called Fuzzlewumps. They were friendly and loved to play in the meadows, exploring every nook and \n",
    " cranny of their beautiful home.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among the Fuzzlewumps, there was a curious little one named Wiggles. Wiggles was always eager to learn and discover \n",
    "new things. One sunny morning, as Wiggles and their friends skipped through the wildflowers, they noticed a \n",
    "peculiar-looking plant with bright purple petals.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Wow, look at that flower! It's so pretty!\" Wiggles exclaimed, pointing towards the plant.\n",
    "\n",
    "But their wise elder, Grandpa Fuzzlefur, quickly spoke up, \"Ah, my dear Wiggles, that is the sneeze-bloom. It may \n",
    "look beautiful, but it carries a secret.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"A secret? What do you mean, Grandpa?\" Wiggles asked, tilting their furry head in curiosity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grandpa Fuzzlefur settled himself down on a soft, mossy rock and beckoned Wiggles and their friends to gather around. \n",
    "\"You see, the sneeze-bloom releases tiny particles into the air, and when these particles come into contact with some \n",
    "Fuzzlewumps, they can cause a reaction.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"A reaction?\" Wiggles inquired, eyes wide with wonder.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Yes,\" Grandpa nodded, \"some Fuzzlewumps might start sneezing, get itchy skin, or even feel a bit sick. We call this \n",
    "a 'Fuzzle-allergy.'\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Wiggles and their friends listened carefully, intrigued by this newfound knowledge. \"But why do some Fuzzlewumps get \n",
    "allergies, Grandpa?\" asked a little Fuzzlewump named Snicker.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grandpa Fuzzlefur smiled kindly and explained, \"Allergies happen when our bodies think something harmless, like the \n",
    "sneeze-bloom's particles, is actually dangerous. Our immune system tries to protect us by overreacting, which causes \n",
    "those funny sneezes and itchiness.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"But what can we do about it, Grandpa?\" another little Fuzzlewump named Fuzzywig wondered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grandpa Fuzzlefur patted Fuzzywig's head gently. \"The first thing we do is try to avoid the things that give us \n",
    "allergies. If you notice a sneeze-bloom, it's best to stay away from it. And if you're not sure about something, \n",
    "it's always good to ask your parents or a wise elder.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"But what if we accidentally touch or smell it?\" Wiggles asked, a little worried.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"If that happens, don't worry,\" Grandpa reassured. \"You can let your parents know, and they'll help you feel better. \n",
    "They might give you special potions called 'antihistamines' to ease the sneezes and itchiness.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Wiggles and their friends nodded, feeling better knowing that there was a way to handle allergies.\n",
    "\n",
    "From that day on, the Fuzzlewumps were extra careful during their adventures. They played in the meadows, sang songs, \n",
    "and danced among the flowers, all while keeping an eye out for any sneeze-blooms or other allergy triggers.\n",
    "\n",
    "And so, the Fuzzlewumps lived happily in Harmony Hills, cherishing their bond of friendship and learning from their wise \n",
    "elder, Grandpa Fuzzlefur, about the wonders of their world and how to stay safe from those little pesky allergies. And \n",
    "so the story goes, reminding us all that a little knowledge and care can make our lives more magical and allergy-free!'''"
