Lily\\'s body didn\\'t get along well with the pollen they released into the air.\\n\\nAs they continued their adventure, they met a friendly dog named Max. He wagged his tail happily, excited to meet Lily. But as Lily got closer to Max, she started to itch all over. It was Max\\'s fur! Lily\\'s body didn\\'t like the tiny particles that clung to the dog\\'s fur.\\n\\nLily\\'s mom explained that allergies were like Lily\\'s body having very picky taste buds. Just as some people might not like the taste of certain foods, Lily\\'s body didn\\'t like the pollen or Max\\'s fur. Even though these things might be harmless to others, Lily\\'s body saw them as intruders it needed to protect her from.\\n\\nBut Lily wasn\\'t discouraged.
